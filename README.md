## 🚀 Featured Project: Veo Match Analyser  
**Live Colab Demo**: [Open Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QCMw6ulTRt0S3GX4qtH9beAgrUeeAbI4#scrollTo=0gLZlyTr81fm) | **Streamlit Dashboard** (coming soon)  

- **What It Does**: Auto-extracts stats from Veo videos – forward passes, shots on goal, xG estimates.  
- **Tech**: Python (Pandas, OpenCV for frame detection, Plotly for viz).  
- **Football Impact**: Analysed Nations FC games – spotted 15% more progressive actions missed by eye. Outputs: CSV timelines + pitch heatmaps.  
- **Screenshots**:
 *Screenshots (Live Soon)*: Event timeline & pitch heatmap from Nations FC test match.
  
*Run it yourself: Import your Veo export → Get coach-ready insights in minutes.*

## 📊 freeCodeCamp Python Projects (Football-Ready Foundations)  
These built my data muscle – now applied to sports (e.g., viz for injury trends, regression for form prediction). All in Colab for easy forking.

| Project | Description | Football Tie-In | Colab Link |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Demographic Data Analyser** | Cleans/explores census data: filtering, grouping, trend viz (Pandas/NumPy). | Scout demographics for talent ID (e.g., regional player pools). | [Open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L9CdL29fY0PXoO-BWCgk-IlPRrHAOEho) |
| **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator** | Stats engine for risk/return (NumPy arrays). | Measure player consistency (e.g., shot variance) or team form volatility. | [Open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X4-MVFZpMETs7Zxb9ZkUBk8ndi4t11fr) |
| **Medical Data Visualisation** | Heart disease analysis: correlations, scatters (Matplotlib/Seaborn). | Injury risk viz – age/gender trends for squad management. | [Open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v9ui6SU7bm3Xu332qTtANqGIAtkxdbQp) |
| **Sea Level Predictor** | Time-series regression + predictions (SciPy/NumPy). | Forecast team performance (e.g., xG trends over seasons). | [Open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EcE0A2GqhvRC4EUi-2g3_HsLSbOxRubk) |

**Cert Badge**: [Data Analysis with Python – freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/rkankamdata/data-analysis-with-python-v7) (Completed 2025).
